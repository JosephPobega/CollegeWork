Write a program that:

Creates an array of 100 random integers that range between  1 and 10,000
array[i] = (int)(Math.random() * 10000) +1 
Then prompt the user to enter an index number
use Scanner(System.in)
Then use a try and catch block to capture integers that are grader than 99
Use the superclass Exception in the catch statement
If an index is out of range a statement should appear stating so
