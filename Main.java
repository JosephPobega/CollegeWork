/*
  What would the following code print? (1 point)
    The following code would print (just run it and copy, thats
    what I would do)

    
    How would you make it better formatted? (1 point)
        I would put println on all statements
        
        
        also do:
        System.out.println("2 + 3 is " + 2 + 3);
        ^^^

    Name you class (program) SISession1 and show your code. (1 point
    This one is obvious ^^

    What is the difference between print and println?
    println prints output on one line while print joins the next line 
    under it without space

    
    What is the difference between line 8 and line 9?
    the difference is that line 8 is just basic arthethmetic 
    and line 9 is the end of the main function.
